# Aazhvaar Telugu

Unicode font for the variant of the Telugu script used by the Shrivaishnavas to write religous Tamil texts. The font uses Tamil-style glyphs to represent the Tamil phonemes /ḻ/ & / ṟ/.  As a liturgical language, Tamil texts are frequently expressed in the Telugu script for reading and recitation by Telugu speakers.

Both Tamil and Telugu being Dravidian languages share a core set of phonemes that made it relatively easy to express the Tamil language in the Telugu script. However, two Tamil consonants, namely LLLA ழ ḻ & RRA ற ṟ, tended to be problematic. This was resolved by the wholesale importation of these two Tamil consonants and simply treating them as if they were Telugu consonants
